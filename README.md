The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a well-known combinatorial optimization problem that seeks to determine the shortest possible route for a salesman to visit a set of cities exactly once and return to the original city. The TSP is classified as an NP-hard problem, meaning that no efficient algorithm is known to solve all instances of the problem in polynomial time.

One approach for solving this problem involves using Hopfield networks, a type of recurrent artificial neural network. Hopfield networks are designed to find approximate solutions to optimization problems by minimizing an energy function that encodes the problem's constraints and objectives.

For this project, it is used numpy and the concept of reducing energy of the system given by the Hopfield Approach.
